Whether you came across this site from Google, found me on Twitter/X, or some secret third option, I hope that you find something to your liking here (even if the only thing that you like is the site itself).\n<br>\n<br>More about me can be found under the About tab.\n<br>\n<br>But the purpose of this post isn't to introduce myself, it's to introduce this place - home of multiple and infinite projects that are dear to me.\n<br>\n<br>This page - the home page - will be where a blog of sorts resides. I'll be using it to notify everyone of updates, and occasionally churn out a piece about writing-related thoughts and inspirations.\n<br>\n<br>I'll try to restrain the amount of activism that I display here, but given my own identity and the stories that I choose to tell, that may not hold.\n<br>\n<br>The \"What's Happening?\" page lets you know what stage I am on any current projects that I'm juggling. Information includes a short description of each goal, along with a progress bar showing how far along I am. Everything else is fairly self-explanatory - a \"Short Stories\" page for easy access to my short stories; a \"Novels\" page for easy access to my novels; and a \"Miscellaneous\" page for any stories written in a non-traditional format, along with any articles or story collections.\n<br>\n<br>Andâ€¦that's that. Feel free to give my Twitter a follow for more updates both personal and professional! See you all later!<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",
