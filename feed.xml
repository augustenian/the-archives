  <p>
    Hello, world!
<br>
<br>I'm Erin, the author of every written thing on this website, and I'm here to extend a hand in welcome! Whether you came across this site from Google, found me on Twitter/X, or some secret third option, I hope that you find something to your liking here (even if the only thing that you like is the site itself).
<br>
<br>More about me can be found under the About tab.
<br>
<br>But the purpose of this post isn't to introduce myself, it's to introduce this place - home of multiple and infinite projects that are dear to me.
<br>
<br>This page - the home page - will be where a blog of sorts resides. I'll be using it to notify everyone of updates, and occasionally churn out a piece about writing-related thoughts and inspirations.
<br>
<br>I'll try to restrain the amount of activism that I display here, but given my own identity and the stories that I choose to tell, that may not hold.
<br>
<br>The "What's Happening?" page lets you know what stage I am on any current projects that I'm juggling. Information includes a short description of each goal, along with a progress bar showing how far along I am. Everything else is fairly self-explanatory - a "Short Stories" page for easy access to my short stories; a "Novels" page for easy access to my novels; and a "Miscellaneous" page for any stories written in a non-traditional format, along with any articles or story collections.
<br>
<br>Andâ€¦that's that. Feel free to give my Twitter a follow for more updates both personal and professional! See you all later!<br>
